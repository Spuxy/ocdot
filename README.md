### Motivation 💫

I am loosing track of dotfiles and i would like to know what i have `stowed` and what i have not

### Usage

We need to install a few dependencies, but dont worry ! 🚀 I will check if those binaries are on your local machine.
Dependencies:

- `go`
- `stow`

To run this, you need to build that, please use my `Makefile`.
Use this:

```sh
make build
```

TODO: create gopher

##### TODO: explain layout of structure

Explain the point, that you have core dotfiles,
that are the same across all systems
and then you have system specific dotfiles for linux/macos or windows, which dont change often.
