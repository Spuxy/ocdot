### Motivation ðŸ’«
I am loosing track of dotfiles and i would like to know what i have `stowed` and what i have not


### Usage
We need to install a few dependencies, but dont worry ! ðŸš€ I will check if those binaries are on your local machine. 
Dependencies:
- `go`
- `stow`

To run this, you need to build that, please use my `Makefile`.
Use this:
```sh
make build
```
